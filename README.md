# ITLogger Backend

> Express backend for the ITLogger app from Brad Traversy's React Front to Back course on Udemy. Brad's front-end scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/it-logger).

## Usage

### `npm install`

### `npm run server`

Runs the app with the backend express server<br>
You need to set the config file to your own MongoDB URI and rename it to config.env.<br>
Server [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the backend and the front-end at the same time. You can use Brad's front-end or create your own. However, if you do choose to use Brad's front end, you will need to adapt some of the actions and reducers, as this server responses differs from the one given by the JSON server.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
Server [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
